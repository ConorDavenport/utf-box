# utf-box
[This unicode box drawer](https://conordavenport.github.io/utf-box/) is
a project I did to learn the React Javascript framework, and I wanted an
easy way to generate unicode boxes.

Draw your box and when it's ready, click select and select your box to
copy it into your clipboard.

It's pretty janky and doesn't work on mobile yet.
